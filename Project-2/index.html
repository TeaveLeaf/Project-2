          Mental health is a personâ€™s mental well-being. It can affect how a
          person feels, thinks, and acts. It can even affect a person physically
          like making a person feel as if they have less energy than before or
          having trouble sleeping. Mental health is often overlooked in society.
          This is a problem not many people are aware of. Common mental
          illnesses such as depression and anxiety often go ignored and can lead
          to severe consequences.

        <p>
          Socially, mental health is believed to not be as important as physical
          health which is the main reason it is overlooked so often. While
          physical health is important, mental health is just as important. Just
          like being worried over a sprained ankle, you should be worried if you
          see someone acting more depressed than usual. Ignoring how someone is
          feeling mentally can lead to terrible consequences, being aware and
          showing that you care can mean so much to people who are struggling.
